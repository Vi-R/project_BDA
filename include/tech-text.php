    ANT technologies are analog in the market. For example, high-regeneration asphalt concrete technology allows the use of RAP (milled asphalt) in an amount of 50% to 99.9% by weight of new regenerated asphalt mixtures. This was made possible thanks to the technology "Organic asphalt regenerator" ANT ", capable of rejuvenating bitumen at the molecular level." The ANT asphalt regenerator initiates redox reactions due to this reaction, when it destroys the surface of asphaltenes, which are new substances with low molecular weight hydrocarbon chains.
